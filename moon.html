    The Moon, with a diameter of around 2,000 miles, is the only object orbiting Earth. It is roughly 239,000 miles away from Earth. The Moon plays a very important role for humans across many different areas of study. The Moon allowed early humans to keep time, is a major piece of inspiration for artists, served as the entry point to the study of astrology, and even plays a role in various world religions. Since 1969, humans have stepped foot on the Moon six different times. Astronauts and other scholars are constantly learning new things about our Moon, which is very exciting!
