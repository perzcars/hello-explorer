    The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite, a rocky and cratered world that has fascinated humans for centuries. It influences our tides, lights up the night sky, and has been the destination for historic space missions. From its bright, silvery surface to the deep shadows of its craters, the Moon’s landscapes are both mysterious and beautiful. Studying the Moon helps us understand more about the history of our solar system, the formation of planets, and the possibilities of future space exploration.
