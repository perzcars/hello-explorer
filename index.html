    The Earth, a planet in our Solar System (and the one we know the most about), is the 3rd planet from the Sun and where we call home! From the equator, the Earth is almost 8,000 miles in width and consists of mostly oceans, with only roughly 30% of the Earth's surface being land. Over 8 billion humans call Earth home, along with millions of species of other organisms, and it is the only planet in our Solar System (as of now) that is able to harbor life! Historically, the warmest place on Earth is Death Valley in California and the coldest place on Earth is on Antarctica.</p>
